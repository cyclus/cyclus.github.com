This directory contains a dockerfile with all dependencies for
building the website.  This is used by the docker based build targets added to
the makefile.  This image will automatically use the latest cymetric image from GHCR, 
which is updated automatically via GitHub Actions on any changes to Cyclus, Cycamore, or Cymetric.
