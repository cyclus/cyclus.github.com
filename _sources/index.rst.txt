|cyclus| is the next-generation agent-based nuclear :doc:`fuel cycle simulator
<basics/fcs_background>`, providing flexibility to users and developers
through a :term:`dynamic resource exchange` solver and :term:`plug-in`,
user-developed :term:`agent` framework.

The goal of |cyclus| is to enable a broad spectrum of :term:`fuel cycle
simulation <fuel cycle simulator>` while providing a low barrier to entry for
new users and agent developers. |Cyclus| engages with potential module
developers and encourages them to join a vibrant community in an
:doc:`expanding ecosystem <basics/ecosystem>`.  Users and developers are
always welcome and encouraged to use or contribute to the |cyclus| project.

The |Cyclus| project repository is located at http://github.com/cyclus/cyclus
