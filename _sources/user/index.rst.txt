|Cyclus| User Guide
===================

This guide covers the basics of installation, creating simulation input files,
and running them.  If you haven't already, you should take a look at
:ref:`Fundamental Concepts in Cyclus <basics-concepts>`.

Archetypes
----------

Collections of :term:`archetypes <archetype>` are provided by various teams
and individuals for use by |Cyclus| users.

Cycamore
~~~~~~~~
   The Cycamore library of archetypes is provided by the |Cyclus| development
   team as a basic set of archetypes for modeling simple nuclear fuel cycles.

.. toctree::

    cycamoreagents

Cyclus Testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   The |Cyclus| kernel includes some archetype for testing the basic
   functionality of the kenel.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   cyclusagents


Third-Party Archetypes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Several useful archetypes have been developed by the community outside the
purview of the Cyclus project itself and are listed here.  These archetypes do
not necessarily adhere to the same standards of quality (documentation,
testint, etc.) as Cyclus and Cycamore code - users are responsible for
evaluating their suitability.

**Bright-lite**
   The University of Texas - Austin is developing a set of archetypes for fuel
   fabrication and reactors that rely on interpolation tables for more
   accurate prediction of fresh fuel compositions and estimates of fuel
   depletion.

**Cyborg**
   The University of Tennessee is working with Oak Ridge National Lab to
   develop archetypes that will use ORIGEN calculations to improve the
   estimate of nuclear fuel properties.

**Mbmore Archetypes** (https://github.com/cnerg/mbmore)
    Facility archetypes that utilize a random number generator to create
    non-deterministic behaviors.  General methods controlling the behavior
    (including random number generation and Gaussian distributions) are defined in
    the `behavior functions
    <https://github.com/cnerg/mbmore/blob/main/src/behavior_functions.h>`_.

- `:mbmore:RandomEnrich
  <https://github.com/cnerg/mbmore/blob/main/src/RandomEnrich.h>`_

- `:mbmore:RandomSink
  <https://github.com/cnerg/mbmore/blob/main/src/RandomSink.h>`_

**rwc Archetypes** (https://github.com/rwcarlsen/rwc-archetypes)
    This is a collection of miscellaneous archetypes made by Robert Carlsen to
    support optimization work and other side projects:

- `:rwc:LookInst
  <https://github.com/rwcarlsen/rwc-archetypes/blob/master/look_inst.h>`_

- `:rwc:FleetReactor
  <https://github.com/rwcarlsen/rwc-archetypes/blob/master/fleet_reactor.h>`_

- `:rwc:PatternSink
  <https://github.com/rwcarlsen/rwc-archetypes/blob/master/pattern_sink.h>`_

- `:rwc:Storage
  <https://github.com/rwcarlsen/rwc-archetypes/blob/master/storage.h>`_

**Peddler** (https://github.com/ergs/peddler)
Peddler is a Cyclus Package used to simulate the transport of material from one facility to another.

- `peddler:truck<https://github.com/ergs/peddler/blob/master/peddler/truck.py>`_

- `peddler:reactor<https://github.com/ergs/peddler/blob/master/peddler/reactor.py>_`


**Cyder**(https://github.com/arfc/cyder)
A generic nuclear repository model intended to be used within the Cyclus nuclear fuel cycle simulator. It contains a conditioning facility and a nuclear repository model that places spent fuel packages in a repository based on its temperature and the constraints of the repository.


**OpenMCyclus**(https://github.com/arfc/openmcyclus/)
OpenMCyclus introduces an archetype that couples OpenMC depletion with Cyclus a reactor.

- `openmcyclus:DepleteReactor<https://github.com/arfc/openmcyclus/blob/main/openmcyclus/DepleteReactor.py>`_


**D3ploy**(https://github.com/arfc/d3ploy/)
A collection of Cyclus manager archetypes for demand driven deployment. The goal of this package is to provide three types of mathematical basis for predicting supply and demand of commodities within Cyclus; Non-optimizing (NO) deterministic optimization (DO), and Stochastic optimization (SO).

- `d3ploy:DemandDrivenDeploymentInst<https://github.com/arfc/d3ploy/blob/master/d3ploy/demand_driven_deployment_inst.py>`_

- `d3ploy:SupplyDrivenDeploymentInst<https://github.com/arfc/d3ploy/blob/master/d3ploy/supply_driven_deployment_inst.py>`_

- `d3ploy:DemandFac<https://github.com/arfc/d3ploy/blob/master/d3ploy/demand_fac.py>`_


**ann_pwr**(https://github.com/jbae11/ann_pwr)
This Cyclus Reactor module is created to perform varying burnup and enrichment calculations for LWRs using a trained neural network model to predict UNF composition.

- `ann_pwr:ann_pwr<https://github.com/jbae11/ann_pwr/blob/ann_lwr/ann_lwr/ann_lwr.py>`_
