Getting and Building |Cyclus| From Source
=========================================

.. warning::

    In the cyclus ecosystem, only versions whose micro or patch number
    (the third and last number) are zero  are considered **stable**.
    Other releases where the version number is greater than zero are
    bugfix and maintainence releases and are considered **unstable**.
    For example, a release number of ``1.42.0`` is stable, while
    ``1.42.3`` is unstable.


The |Cyclus| Library Suite
--------------------------
The |cyclus| ecosystem is composed of two projects:

  * |Cyclus| Core, comprising core kernel functionality
  * Cycamore, a physics and other domain module repository

Installation information is provided in the README of each repository, and the
core must be installed before Cycamore. Accordingly, installation steps are as
follows:

  #. Visit the `Cyclus repo <https://github.com/cyclus/cyclus>`_ and follow the
     installation instructions on the main page (README.rst)
  #. Visit the `Cycamore readme <https://github.com/cyclus/cycamore>`_ and
     follow the installation instructions on the main page (README.rst)

Supported Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Currently, two specific systems are supported:

  * Linux 64-bit (Ubuntu 12+ recommended)
  * MacOSX 8 64-bit

Unfamiliar with git and Github?
-------------------------------

For the git uninitiated, one must perform the following steps to acquire |cyclus|:

  #. `Set Up git`_ shows one how to set up SSH keys and git user info
  #. Fork the |cyclus| repository, as shown in `Fork A Repo`_

Note that each |cyclus| repository has **two** branches:

  * master -- the latest stable release of the library
  * develop -- the latest working copy that passes all tests

The above branches are synchronized with each other, and should be used in tandem
(i.e., use master (|Cyclus|) with master (Cycamore) or develop with develop only).
