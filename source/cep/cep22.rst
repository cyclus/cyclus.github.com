Overview
========

The current state of logging in |cyclus|, i.e., reporting results to `stdout`
and `stderr`, has been identified as non-ideal. A non-deferred version of this
CEP will provide a new logging methodology, an implementation thereof, and a
discussion a series of examples of how logging should occur at both the kernel
and archetype development level (if neccessary).
