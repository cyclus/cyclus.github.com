Abstract
========

This CEP is intended to define fundamental principles of the |Cyclus|
organization and a basis for governance within this community.  Prior to this
document, governance was ad-hoc within a single institution.  As the
individual and institutional relationships expand, such a document is
considered important to maintain the health of the community.

Mission
=======

The mission of the |Cyclus| organization is to foster the ongoing development
of the open source |Cyclus| ecosystem as both a research platform and a user
tool for the study of dynamic nuclear fuel cycles.

Definitions
===========

|Cyclus| Ecosystem
-------------------

The |Cyclus| ecosystem is an organic collection of individuals, institutions,
and their contributions to nuclear fuel cycle modeling and analysis within the
|Cyclus| framework.  Those contributions may be distinct projects, individual
lines of code, or some combination, and they may be owned individually,
collectively, institutionally, or in some combination.

|Cyclus| Organization
----------------------

The |Cyclus| organization (hereafter, "the Organization") is the subset of the
|Cyclus| ecosystem that is managed and owned collectively under the |Cyclus|
Github organization.  This document is designed to provide a basis for
governance within this organization.  Membership in this organization is
governed by a process defined below.

Council of Principal Investigators
-----------------------------------

????

Design Philosophy
==================

The fundamental design philosophy of |Cyclus| provides a basis for guiding the
development of the components owned by the Organization and resolving
technical disputes that may arise during such development.  Such a philosophy
is embodied in the following set of principles.  Like any such system, the
relative value placed in any single principle may not be universally held by
all members of the Organization.

Flexibility
------------

The foundational principle of |Cyclus| is to provide flexibility in both the
range of nuclear fuel cycles that can be modeled and the range of analyses and
use cases that may be applied to those cycles.  

Open
-----

The Organization is commited to an open source development paradigm

Scalability
------------


Stability
----------

Stability of |Cyclus| components is an important prerequisite for attracting a
community of developers and users.  A stable |Cyclus| kernel is required to
attract other archetype developers and stability in the other components is
required to attract end users.

Sustainability
---------------


Usability
----------



Code of Conduct
================

Some other related codes of conduct during the development of our own:

* http://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct.html
* https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/


Change Control Process
========================

The primary context for interaction among members of the Organization is the
discussion and review of changes being made to the software.  Such changes are
enabled by the pull request features of Github technology that hosts the
primary software repositories.

1. A developer or team of developers makes changes in a Github branch.
2. Once a cohesive set of changes has been completed, a pull request is
   generated that offers those changes as an ammendment to the primary branch.
3. All members of the Organization are welcome to comment on all technical
   aspects of the offered changes, including specfically:
   * style
   * technical correctness
   * adherence to the design philosophy
4. At least one member of the Organization that was not involved in the
   development of the changes must approve the changes.
5. Any member of the Organization can block the adoption of changes on
   technical grounds.
6. Changes are adopted when at least one member of the Organization has
   approved the changes and no members of the Organization are blocking the
   changes.

Best Practices
---------------

(should these be in their own CEP)

1. Substantive changes to the work of others should require those others to
   comment during the review process.
2. Individual pull requests should be as small as possible to facilitate
   timely review.
3. Before embarking on long time-intensive changes, it is wise to collect the
   opinion of the |Cyclus| community on the value of such changes, generally
   through the mailing list.

Resolution of Technical Conflicts
==================================

It is natural and inevitable that during the process of implementing
improvements, a technical difference of opinion may arise.  This is part of
the healthy interaction in such a community. Most technical problems can be
resolved in more than one way and there may no single correct answer.  

The first mechanism for resolution of such conflicts is through discussion
among major parties with the shared goal of seeking a common solution.
Different modes of communication can help facilitate resolution in different
ways.  Synchronous communication (chat, phone and/or video conference) can
often lead to more creative solutions that satisfy all parties.  Inclusion of
a knowledgeable third party can also help identify points of agreement and
points of disagreement, leading to a more focused and successful outcome.
Adherence to the Code of Conduct becomes extremely important during such
discussions, and should be policed strictly.

It is possible that such a process is unable to reach a resolution.
Presumably, the proposed changes are technically correct, having been reviewed
for

If such a process is unable to reach a resolution, the decision can be
escalated for the review of the Council of PIs.  This process presumes that
the review process has resulted in a change proposal that is technically
correct and conforms to the appropriate style guide, and therefore that
continued disagreement lies in the interpretation and relative evaluation of
the design philosophy.  This leads to the following process:

1. Each party writes a justification of their position in particular context
   of the design principles.
2. Each party writse a rebuttal to the other party's justification, also in
   the context of the design principles.

The Council of PIs will evaluate these arguments and make a decision in the
context of the overall design philosophy.

Resolution of Social Conflicts
===============================

It is equally inevitable that conflicts will arise that are less technical in
nature, generally as violations of the Code of Conduct.  This is not a part of
the healthy interaction of such a community and must be carefully managed.
This section outlines a spectrum of escalating responses to such social
conflicts and infractions.  This set of responses: 

* is specifically designed to allow for most conflicts to be resolved quickly and
  quietly without escalation,
* directly reinforces a culture of healthy cooperation and collaboration, 
* presumes that all members of the Organization agree to the Code of Conduct,
* presumes that all members of the Organization trust the process to bring
  resolution, and
* empowers all members of the Organization to enforce the Code of Conduct,
  whether they experience violations directly or witness them as third
  parties.

1. Private Flags
-----------------

The first response is to simply inform the member that they have commited a
violation of the Code of Conduct - to "raise a flag".  Importantly, this first
response is intended to:

* be private to the issuer and the receiver,
* require little effort,
* imply little judgment, and
* impose little stigma.

Any time that a flag is raised, a response is expected.  At minimum the
response should acknowledge the flag, but may also require an apology.  If the
original transgression occurred publicly, the response should also be public,
even though the flag was private.

Although the analogy is imperfect, flags can be viewed as the social
equivalent to comments on style in the technical review.  As such, they are
simple reminders of an accidental transgression that should result in equally
simple corrective action.

2. Public Flags
----------------

Very similar to a Private Flag, this response is issued more publicly in order
to include a broader segment of the community.  This may be appropriate when
the violation has been committed by or directed at a group.  

It is important to recognize that even in situations where the issuer of such
a flag intends little judgment, a Public Flag can both imply judgment and
impose substantial stigma, and can become inflammatory.  Recognizing this does
not negate the utility of a Public Flag, but calls for great care in its use.

Any member of the community is empowered to choose this response at their own
discretion.

3. Monitored Flags
-------------------

Clearly an escalation from the previous responses, this follows the same
pattern as other flags, but explicitly includes one or more members of the
Council of PIs, as appropriate.

Escalation to this response implies that previous attempts to resolve the
situation were unsuccessful and/or that there is an emerging pattern of
transgression.  The PI are included both to make them aware of the situation
and to invite them to take independent action.  This response also implies an
explicit judgment and hence imposes stigma on the recipient.

Any member of the community is empowered to choose this response at their own
discretion.

4. Greivance
-------------

A party may explicitly request action by the PIs when they feel that other
avenues have been exhausted.  Need a formal process for this??
