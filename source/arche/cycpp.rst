Using the Cyclus Preprocessor
==================================

    <table style="width:100%">
    <tr><td>

A key part of the |Cyclus| agent and module development infrastructure is
a |Cyclus|-aware C++ preprocessor called |cycpp|.  This preprocessor 
inspects the agents that you write and then - based on the directives you 
have given it - generates code that conforms to the |cyclus| agent API.
This allows you to focus on coding up the desired agent behavior rather 
than worrying about the tedious and error-prone process of making your
agents conform to the |Cyclus| kernel.

Before we continue there are a couple of noteworthy points about |cycpp|:

* Even when using the preprocessor, agents are still completely valid C++
  and may be compiled without running |cycpp| - though they probably
  won't do the correct thing in a simulation.
* If your module is compiled with the CMake macros found in UseCyclus, 
  |cycpp| is run automatically for you on all relevant files.

Without further ado, let's dive in!

Pragma |Cyclus|
-----------------
The preprocessor functions by defining a suite of |cyclus|-directives that 
|cycpp| picks up (but that plain old ``cpp`` ignores).  These all start 
with the prefix ``#pragma cyclus`` and fall into one of two broad categories:

1. **Annotation directives** and
2. **Code generation directives**.

The annotation directives allow you specify information and metadata
(documentation, default values, maximum shape sizes, etc.) about your agents.
The code generation directives replace themselves with C++ code inside of the
agents based on the annotations provided. *The use of these directives is
entirely optional.*  However, in their absence you must implement the
corresponding agent API yourself.

.. _pragma-cyclus-var:

Annotation Directives
-----------------------

|Cyclus| agents are based on the notion of **state variables**.  These are
member variables of your agents whose values (should) fully determine the
state of the your agent at any time step. State variables are important
because they are what is written to and read from the database, they may be
specified in the input file and have an associated schema, and they define the
public interface for the agent.

Thus, the most important annotation directive is the **state variable
directive**.  This must be written within the agent's class declaration and
applies to the next member variable declaration that it sees. This directive
not only defines the annotations for a variable, but also declares it as being
a state variable.  It has the following signature:

**State variable annotation signature:**

.. code-block:: c++

    #pragma cyclus var <dict>

Here, the ``<dict>`` argument must evaluate to a Python dictionary (or other mapping). 
For example, 

**State variable annotation example:**

.. code-block:: c++

    #pragma cyclus var {"default": 42.0, "units": "n/cm2/s"}
    double flux;

These two lines declare that the member variable ``flux`` is in fact a state
variable of type double with the given metadata.  The keys of this dictionary
may be anything you desire. Though because they are eventually persisted to
JSON the keys must be strings. Certain keys have special semantic
meaning. Furthermore, there are two keys - ``type`` and ``index`` - that are set by 
|cycpp| itself and should not be specified explicitly. State variables may have any 
C++ type that is allowed by the database backend that is being used.  For a listing of
valid types please refer to the :doc:`dbtypes` page. :ref:`cycpp-table-1`
contains a listing of all special keys and their meanings.

                 ``#pragma cyclus var {...}`` as it is set automatically by 
                 cycpp. Feel free to use this downstream in your class or in a

    default      The default value for this variable that is used if otherwise 
                 unspecified. The value must match the type of the variable.
    shape        The shape of a variable length datatypes. If present this must
                 be a list of integers whose length (rank) makes sense for this
                 type. Specifying positive values will (depending on the 
                 backend) turn a variable length type into a fixed length one 
                 with the length of the given value. Putting a ``-1`` in the 
                 shape will retain the variable length nature along that axis. 
                 Fixed length variables are normally more performant so it is 
                 often a good idea to specify the shape where possible. For 
                 example, a length-5 string would have a shape of ``[5]`` and 
                 a length-10 vector of variable length strings would have a 
                 shape of ``[10, -1]``.
    doc          Documentation string.
    tooltip      Brief documentation string for user interfaces.
    units        The physical units, if any.
    userlevel    Integer from 0 - 10 for representing ease (0) or difficulty (10) 
                 in using this variable, default 0.
    alias        The name of the state variable in the schema and input file.
                 If this is not present it defaults to the C++ variable name. 
    uilabel      The text string a UI will display as the name of this input on
                 the UI input form.
    uitype       The type of the input field in reference in a UI, 
                 currently supported types are; incommodity, outcommodity, 
                 commodity, range, combobox, facility, prototype, recipe, nuclide, 
                 and none.
                 For 'nuclide' when the type is an int, the values will be read in 
                 from the input file in human readable string format ('U-235') and 
                 automatically converted to results of ``pyne::nucname::id()``
                 (922350000) in the database and on the archetype.
    range        This indicates the range associated with a range type.
                 It must take the form of ``[min, max]`` or 
                 ``[min, max, (optional) step size]``.
    categorical  This indicates the decrete values a combobox Type can take. It
                 must take the form of ``[value1, value2, value3, etc]``. 
    schematype   This is the data type that is used in the schema for input file
                 validation. This enables you to supply just the data type
                 rather than having to overwrite the full schema for this state
                 variable. In most cases - when the shape is rank 0 or 1 such
                 as for scalars or vectors - this is simply a string. In cases
                 where the rank is 2+ this is a list of strings. Please refer to

|Cyclus| also has a notion of class-level **agent annotations**. These are
specified by the **note directive**. Similarly to the state variable
annotations, agent annotations must be given inside of the class declaration.
They also have a very similar signature:

**Note (agent annotation) signature:**

.. code-block:: c++

    #pragma cyclus note <dict>

Again, the ``<dict>`` argument here must evaluate to a Python dictionary.
For example, 

**Note (agent annotation) example:**

.. code-block:: c++

    #pragma cyclus note {"doc": "If I wanna be rich, I’ve got to find myself"}

Unlike state variables, agent annotations only have a few special members.  One of 
this is ``vars`` which contains the state variable annotations! 
:ref:`cycpp-table-2` contains a listing of all special keys and their meaning.

                 respecively. If the class inherits from ``cyclus::Agent`` but

--------------

If you find dictionaries too confining, |cycpp| also has an **exec directive**. 
This allows you to execute arbitrary Python code which is added to the global
namespace the state variables and agent annotations are evaluated within.  This 
directive may be placed anywhere and is not confined to the class declaration, 
like above.  However, it is only executed during the annotations phase of 
preprocessing.  The signature for this directive is:

**Exec signature:**

.. code-block:: c++

    #pragma cyclus exec <code>

The ``<code>`` argument may be any valid Python code. A non-trivial example, 

**Exec example:**

.. code-block:: c++

    #pragma cyclus exec from math import pi
    #pragma cyclus exec r = 10

    #pragma cyclus var {"default": 2*pi*r}
    float circumfrence;
    
One possible use for this is to keep all state variable annotations in a
separate sidecar ``*.py`` file and then import and use them rather than
cluttering up the C++ source code.  Such decisions are up to the style of the
developer.

Code Generation Directives
---------------------------

Once all of the annotations have been accumulated, the preprocessor takes
*another* pass through the code.  This time it ignores the annotations
directives and injects C++ code anytime it sees a valid code generation
directive.

The simplest and most powerful of the code generators is known as **the prime
directive**. This engages all possible code generation routines and must live
within the public part of the class declaration.  

**The prime directive:**

.. code-block:: c++

    #pragma cyclus

Unless you are doing something fancy such as manually writing any of the agent 
member functions that |cycpp| generates, the prime directive should be all that 
you ever need.  For example, an agent that does nothing and has no state variables
would be completely defined by the following thanks to the prime directive:

**The prime directive example:**

.. code-block:: c++

    class DoNothingCongress : public cyclus::Institution {
     public:
      DoNothingCongress(cyclus::Context* ctx) {};
      virtual ~DoNothingCongress() {};

      #pragma cyclus
    };

.. raw:: html

    <br />

--------------

For the times when you wish to break the prime directive, you may drill down 
into more specific code generation routines.  These fit into three broad 
categories:

1. **Declaration (decl) directives**,
2. **Definition (def) directives**, and
3. **Implementation (impl) directives**.

The ``decl`` directives generate only the member function declaration and must
be used from within the public part of the agent's class declaration.  The
``def`` generate the member function definition in its entirety including the
function signature.  These may be used either in the class declaration or in
the source file (``*.cc``, ``*.cpp``, etc.).  The ``impl`` directives generate
only the body of the member function, leaving off the function signature.
These are useful for intercepting default behavior while still benefiting from
code generation.  These must be called from with the appropriate function
body.

The signature for the targeted code generation directives is as follows:

**Targeted code generation directive signatures:**

.. code-block:: c++

    #pragma cyclus <decl|def|impl> [<func> [<agent>]]

The first argument must be one of ``decl``, ``def``, or ``impl``, which
determines the kind of code generation that will be performed.  The second,
optional ``<func>`` argument is the member function name that code should be
generated for. The third and final and optional ``<agent>`` argument is the
agent name to code generate for. This argument is useful in the face of
ambiguous or absent C++ scope.  The ``<func>`` argument must be present if
``<agent>`` needs to be specified.

In the absence of optional arguments there are only:

.. code-block:: c++

    #pragma cyclus decl
    #pragma cyclus def

These generate all of the member function declarations and definitions,
respectively.  Note that there is no corresponding ``#pragma cyclus impl``
because function bodies cannot be strung together without the corresponding
signatures encapsulating them.

When the ``<func>`` argument is provided the directive generates only the
definition, declaration, or implementation for the given agent API function.
For example the following would generate the definition for the ``schema()``
function.

.. code-block:: c++

    #pragma cyclus def schema

associated C++ information.

    <br />

--------------

Lastly, the agent's classname may be optionally passed the to the directive. 
This is most useful in source files for the definition directives. This is 
because such directives typically lack the needed class scope.  For example, 
for the snapshot definition of ``MyAgent`` living in ``mynamespace`` we would
use:

.. code-block:: c++

    #pragma cyclus def snapshot mynamespace::MyAgent

Putting It Together
--------------------

|Cyclus| agents are written by declaring certain member variables to be
**state variables**.  This means that they *define* the conditions of the
agent at the start of every time step.  State variables are automatically are
saved and loaded to the database as well a dictating other important
interactions with the kernel.

The preprocessor will generate the desired implementation of key member
functions for your agent.  The easiest way to obtain these is through the
prime directive.

As a simple example, consider a reactor model that has three state variables: 
a flux, a power level, and a flag for whether it is shutdown or not.  
This could be implemented as follows:

.. code-block:: c++

    class Reactor : public cyclus::Facility {
     public:
      Reactor(cyclus::Context* ctx) {};
      virtual ~Reactor() {};

      #pragma cyclus

     private:
      #pragma cyclus var {'default': 4e14, \
                          'doc': 'the core-average flux', \
                          'units': 'n/cm2/2'}
      double flux;

      #pragma cyclus var {'default': 1000, 'units': 'MWe'}
      float power;

      #pragma cyclus var {'doc': 'Are we operating?'}
      bool shutdown;
    };

Note that the state variables may be private or protected if desired.
Furthermore annotations may be broken up over many lines using trailing
backslashes to make the code more readable.  It remains up to you - the module
developer - to implement the desired behavior and logic in the ``Tick()`` and
``Tock()`` member functions.  Fancier tricks are available as needed but this
is the essence of how to write |cyclus| agents.

Abusing the |Cyclus| Preprocessor
==================================
Now that you know how to use |cycpp|, it is useful to know about some of the
more advanced features and how they can be leveraged.

Scope and Annotations
-------------------------

Annotations dictionaries retain the C++ scope that they are defined in even
though they are written in Python.  This allows state variables to refer to
the annotations for previously declared state variables.  Since the scope is
retained, this allows annotations to refer to each other across agent/class
and namespace boundaries.

Because the annotations are dictionaries, the scoping is performed with the
Python scoping operator (``.``) rather than the C++ scoping operator (``::``).
For example, consider the case where we have a ``Spy`` class that lives in the
``mi6`` namespace.  Also in the namespace is the spy's ``Friend``.
Furthermore, somewhere out in global scope lives the Spy's arch-nemesis class
``Enemy``.  

The first rule of scoping is that two state variables on the same class 
share the same scope.  Thus they can directly refer to each other.

.. code-block:: c++

    namespace mi6 {
    class Spy {
      #pragma cyclus var {"default": 7}
      int id;

      #pragma cyclus var {"default": "James Bond, {0:0>3}".format(id['default'])}
      std::string name;
    };
    }; // namespace mi6

In the above, ``id`` is used to help define the annotations for ``name``.  
Note that from within the annotations, other state variables are the annotation
dictionary that was previously defined.  They fo not take on the C++ default value.
This is why we could look up ``id['default']``.

The second rule of scoping is that you are allowed to look into the annotations 
of other classes.  However, to do so you must specifiy the class you are looking 
into.  Looking at our spy's friend

.. code-block:: c++

    namespace mi6 {
    class Friend {
      #pragma cyclus var {"doc": "Normally helps {0}".format(Spy.name['default'])}
      std::string help_first;
    };
    }; // namespace mi6

Here, to access the annotations for Spy's name we had to use ``Spy.name``,
drilling into the Spy class. Inspecting in this way is not limited by C++
access control (public, private, or protected).

Lastly, if the agent we are trying to inspect lives in a completely different
namespace, we must first drill into that namespace. For example, the spy's
main enemy is not part of ``mi6``.  Thus to access the spy's name annotations,
the enemy must write ``mi6.Spy.name``. For example:

.. code-block:: c++

    class Enemy {
        #pragma cyclus var {'default': mi6.Spy.name['default']}
        std::string nemesis;
    };


Inventories
------------
In addition to the normal :doc:`dbtypes`, state variables may also be declared 
with the ``cyclus::Inventories`` type.  This is a special |cyclus| typedef 
of ``std::map<std::string, std::vector<Resource::Ptr> >`` that enables the 
storing of an arbitrary of resources (map values) by the associated commodity 
(map key). While the concept of a resource inventory may be implemented in many 
ways, the advantage in using the ``cyclus::Inventories`` is that the |Cyclus|
kernel knows how to save and load this type as well as represent it in RNG. 
Inventories may be used as normal state variables.  For example: 

.. code-block:: c++

    #pragma cyclus var {'doc': 'my stocks'}
    cyclus::Inventories invs;

It is therefore *hightly* recommended that you store resources in this 
data structure.

State Variable Code Generation Overrides
-----------------------------------------
A powerful feature of most of the code generation directives is that the 
C++ code that is created for a state variable may be optionally replaced with a
code snippet writing in the annotations. This allows you to selectively 
define the C++ behavior without the need to fully rewrite the member function.

A potential use case is to provide a custom schema while still utilizing all other 
parts of |cycpp|.  For example:

.. code-block:: c++

    #pragma cyclus var {'schema': '<my>Famcy RNG here</my>'}
    std::set<int> fibonacci;

This will override the schema only for the Fibonacci state variable.  For a
listing of all code generation functions that may be overridden, please see
:ref:`cycpp-table-1`.

Implementation Hacks

The ``impl`` code generation directives exist primarily to be abused.  Unlike
the ``def`` directives, the implementation directives do not include the
function signature or return statement.  The downside of this is that you must
provide the function signature and the return value yourself.  The upside is
that you may perform any operation before & after the directive! 

For example, suppose that we wanted to make sure that the flux state variable
on the Reactor agent is always snapshotted to the database as the value 42.
However, we did not want to permanently alter the value of this variable.
This could be achieved through the following pattern:

.. code-block:: c++

    void Reactor::Snapshot(cyclus::DbInit di) {
      double real_flux = flux;  // copy the existing flux value.
      flux = 42;  // set the value to wat we want temporarily

      // fill in the code generated implementation of Shapshop()
      #prama cyclus impl snapshot Reactor

      flux = real_flux;  // reset the flux
    }

There are likely much more legitimate uses for this feature. For a complete
listing of the member function information, please see :ref:`cycpp-table-3`.

Custom Schema & Initialization
------------------------------
Suppose that you would like for the schema for a state variable to be different
than the default behavior provided by |cycpp|. Or perhaps you would like more
sophisticated input validation than can is provided by XML and RelaxNG for a 
state variable. This may be easily done by supplying the state variable annotation 
keys ``schema`` and ``infiletodb``. These allow you to inject code snippets 
pertaining to the state variable without interfering with the rest of the 
code generation.

For example, let's say that we have an integer state variable called 
``material_identifier`` that we know always should be even.  This name is
a bit long to make users type in, so we would prefer to expose this in the 
input file as ``matid``.  The RNG snippet that you would use for the ``schema`` 
is thus:

.. code-block:: python

    {'schema': '<element name="matid">' \ 
               '  <data type="int" />' \
               '</element>'}

You can change the data type or any other valid RNG here.

.. note:: Whenever a state variable name is changed in the ``schema``, you 
          must supply an accompanying ``infiletodb``.

Providing a custom ``infiletodb`` is slightly more complicated because you
must give C++ snippets for reading from the input file and for persisting to
the database. The value for ``infiletodb`` is thus not a simple string 
but a dict that has ``read`` and ``write`` keys.  Continuing with the 
example we can ensure that ``matid`` is even after it has been read in.
Here, we do not change the name of the state variable on the agent in 
memory or in the database. 

.. code-block:: python

    {'infiletodb': { \
        'read': 'material_identifier = cyclus::Query<int>(tree, "matid");\n' \
                'if (material_identifier%2 == 1)\n' \
                '  material_identifier++;\n', \
        'write': '->AddVal("material_identifier", material_identifier)\n' \
    }}

For more examples and explanation of what the ``InfileToDb()`` function 
does please refer to other code generated samples and refer to other parts
of the documentation.
Pulling this all together, we can write our custom schema and initialization 
as follows:

.. code-block:: c++

    #pragma cyclus var {'schema': '<element name="matid">' \ 
                                  '  <data type="int" />' \
                                  '</element>', \
                        'infiletodb': { \
                            'read': 'material_identifier = cyclus::Query<int>(tree, "matid");\n' \
                                    'if (material_identifier%2 == 1)\n' \
                                    '  material_identifier++;\n', \
                            'write': '->AddVal("material_identifier", material_identifier)\n' \
                            }\
                        }
    int material_identifier;

Other state variable annotation keys allow you to provide code snippets
in much the same way.
