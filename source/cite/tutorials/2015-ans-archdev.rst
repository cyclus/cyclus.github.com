----------------------------------------------------------------------

| **Where:** `ANS Annual Meeting <http://ansannual.org>`_ (Lone Star A)
| **When:** Wednesday, June 10, 1:00-4:00 PM
| **Who:** `Matt Gidden <http://mattgidden.com>`_ & `The Cyclus Development team <file:///home/wilsonp/UW/research/software/cyclus/cyclus.github.com/gh-build/index.html#contributors>`_
| **Why:** Learn how to develop your own plugin module for the Cyclus Fuel Cycle Simulator

Cyclus is an advanced and flexible fuel cycle simulator capable of modeling
the long-term impacts of different nuclear fuel cycle options.  The tutorial
will demonstrate how developers can integrate their archetype with the
graphical user interface for both scenario definition and output exploration
and describe how to distribute new archetypes as part of the Cyclus
community. Cyclus, its graphical user interfaces, and its development tools
are all freely available for users and developers. Participants should bring a
laptop computer for the installation of Cyclus. Participants are also advised
to attend the :doc:`Users Tutorial<2015-ans-users>` earlier that day.

All participants should 

- start by installing |Cyclus| via instructions on the `Readme
  <https://github.com/cyclus/cyclus>`_

- try out the `Hello Cyclus! <http://fuelcycle.org/arche/hello_world.html>`_
  example

- then we can move on to the `tutorial content
