Installing |Cyclus| with Conda
==============================
Conda is a cross platform, user space package manager aimed at simplifying the 
installation of open source software.  The |cyclus| project uses conda to distribute 
pre-built cyclus and cycamore binaries.

Fresh Install
-------------
If you are new to conda or do not have conda already installed on your system, 
please follow these steps to install |cyclus|.
Basic installation instructions for Conda can be found 
`here <http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install.html>`_. 

1. Download and Install Miniconda

    * Go to the `miniconda downloads page <http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html>`_
      and get the version approriate to your system.
    * Install this to the ``~/miniconda`` directory.  For example, you would 
      use a command similar the following:

      .. code-block:: bash 

          $ bash Miniconda-3.5.2-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -p ~/miniconda

    * Finally, add the ``~/miniconda/bin`` directory to your ``PATH`` either 
      in your current environment or in your ``.bashrc`` or both.

      .. code-block:: bash 

          $ export PATH="${HOME}/miniconda/bin:${PATH}"

2. Configure conda to look for |cyclus|

    * Download this :download:`condarc` file and save it as ``~/.condarc``.  If 
      you'd prefer to do this from the command line, type:

      .. code-block:: bash 

          $ curl -L http://fuelcycle.org/_downloads/condarc >> ~/.condarc

3. Install |Cyclus| and Cycamore

    * Now that conda is installed and ready, installing |Cyclus| is as simple as:

      .. code-block:: bash 
    
          $ conda install cycamore --yes

      Note that installing cycamore will also install cyclus since cyclus is one 
      of cycamore's dependencies.

4. Install Cyclist (optional)

    * Now that cyclus is installed and ready, installing the graphical user interface is 
      simple as:

      .. code-block:: bash 
    
          $ conda install cyclist --yes

And that is it! 

Already Have Conda?
-------------------
If you already have conda installed, installing |Cyclus| is even easier.
You simply need to make sure that the |Cyclus| binstar organization is part of 
your channels.  Please edit the ``channels`` section of your :file:`~/.condarc`
to include the URL ``https://conda.binstar.org/cyclus``.  For example, 

.. code-block:: yaml

	channels:
	  - https://conda.binstar.org/cyclus 
	  - defaults

Once this is done, install |Cyclus| with the following comand.

.. code-block:: bash 
    
    $ conda install cycamore --yes

Note that installing cycamore will also install cyclus since cyclus is one 
of cycamore's dependencies.  Furthermore, you may also optionally install Cyclist,
the graphical user interface tool for cyclus databases. This can be done 
with the following:

.. code-block:: bash 
    
    $ conda install cyclist --yes

Happy simulating!
