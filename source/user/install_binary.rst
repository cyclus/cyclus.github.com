Installing |Cyclus| with binaries
###########

|Cyclus| support two binary installations:

#. `Conda`_
#. `Debian package`_

The Debian package is package aimed at simplifying the installation of open
source software. It contains all the file required to use a specific software,
as well as many different information about it: maintainer, description,
version, dependencies(other softwares or libraries require to use it).  The
|Cyclus| team provides pre-built |Cyclus| and Cycamore Debian package to
simplify the user installation. Those package are available for LTS Ubuntu
version 14.04 and 16.04. It might work on other Linux system, but it at only
been tested on the 2 Ubuntu version mention previously.

Conda is a cross platform, user space package manager aimed at simplifying the
installation of open source software. The |Cyclus| project uses conda to
distribute pre-built |Cyclus| and Cycamore binaries.


*********************
Conda
*********************

1.  a.  If you don't have conda you can find :doc:`here <install_conda>` basic
        instruction to install it and prepare it for cyclus, if you choice to do so
        please directly jump to step 2.

    b.  You have conda already installed on your system, make sure that the
        |Cyclus| binstar organization is part of your channels.  Please edit the
        ``channels`` section of your :file:`~/.condarc` to include the URL
        ``https://conda.binstar.org/cyclus``.  For example, 

        .. code-block:: yaml

        channels:
          - https://conda.binstar.org/cyclus 
          - defaults

2.  Install |Cyclus| and Cycamore: now that conda is installed and ready,
    installing |Cyclus| is as simple as:
  
    .. code-block:: bash 
  
       $ conda install cycamore --yes

    Note that installing cycamore will also install cyclus since cyclus is one 
    of cycamore's dependencies.

3.  Furthermore, you may also optionally install Cyclist, the graphical user
    interface tool for |Cyclus| databases. This can be done with the following:
      
    .. code-block:: bash 
  
        $ conda install cyclist --yes
#.  .. include:: unit_test.rst



*********************
Debian package
*********************

Those installation procedure assume that you are using Ubuntu (LTS) 14.04 or
16.04. This method as only been tested on those ubuntu version. This
installation procedure assumes that you have a root access to you computer.

#. Install cyclus dependencies:
  .. code-block:: bash 

        $ sudo apt-get install libtcmalloc-minimal4 libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-serialization-dev libhdf5-dev libxml++2.6-dev coinor-libcbc-dev
  
  WARNING: This dependency list is ONLY correct for the deb binary installation,
  MORE depednecies are require for a installation from the source. If you
  need/want more information about dependencies installation please read you
  `dependencies installation documentations <put_a_link_there>`_.

#.  Download the |Cyclus| Debian installation  package corresponding to your
    ubuntu version `14.04
    <http://dory.fuelcycle.org:4848/cyclus_1.4.0_14dbaed_ubuntu.14.04.deb>`_ or
    `16.04
    <http://dory.fuelcycle.org:4848/cyclus_1.4.0_14dbaed_ubuntu.16.04.deb>`_.

#.  Install the package running:

     .. code-block:: bash 

        $ sudo dpkg -i CYCLUS_DEB_PACKAGE_MANE.deb

    Please replace the 'CYCLUS_DEB_PACKAGE_MANE.deb' by its proper name.

#.  Download the Cycamore Debian installation  package corresponding to your
    ubuntu version `14.04 <>` or `16.04 <>`.

#.  Install the package running:

    .. code-block:: bash 

       $ sudo dpkg -i CYCAMORE_DEB_PACKAGE_MANE.deb
  
    Please replace the 'CYCAMORE_DEB_PACKAGE_MANE.deb' by its proper name.

#.  .. include::  unit_test.rst
  
  
  
  
  
Happy simulating!
