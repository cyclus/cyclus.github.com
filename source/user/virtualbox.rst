Installing a |Cyclus| VirtualBox
================================

A native Windows installation is not currently explicitly supported. However, a
Virtual Machine image can be downloaded that includes a pre-installation of all
of these dependencies as well as a pre-installation of |Cyclus| and Cycamore. If
you do not have access to a Linux or Unix (MacOS) machine, please follow these
steps:

#. Install `VirtualBox <https://www.virtualbox.org/>`_
#. Download `cyclus_user_environment.ova
   <http://cnergdata.engr.wisc.edu/cyclus/virtual-box/current/cyclus_user_environment.ova>`_
#. Open the .ova file using VirtualBox (File->Import Appliance).
#. Login with the username ``ubuntu`` and pw ``reverse``
#. Open a terminal and type ``conda update``

Congratulations! You now have the same user environment as someone who installed
|Cyclus| on an Ubuntu Linux machine.
