Tutorial
========
This document will walk you through the basics of how to use cymetric on the 
command line, from Python, and even how to write your own metrics!

Cymetric is an extension of |cyclus|, so it is assumed that |cyclus| is already
installed on your system. If not, please visit here for `building it from
source <http://fuelcycle.org/kernel/build_from_source.html>`_. Cymetric
installation instructions are available on `github
<https://github.com/cyclus/cymetric>`_.

Cymetric operates by reading data from a |cyclus| database, computing metrics, 
and writing those metrics back to the database. This way, previously seen 
metrics are stored for later retrieval. The dependencies between metrics are 
automatically computed and evaluated.  

Without further ado, let's dive in!

Command Line Usage
------------------
Cymetric ships with a command line utility, just called ``cymetric``. Since 
cymetric is wholly dependent on acting |cyclus| database, you must supply a
database as an argument on the command line. We'll be using ``test.h5`` and 
``test.sqlite`` as our example database here.  

Table Listing: ``-l``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The first switch here, lowercase-L ``-l``, simply lists the tables in the database.
Note that this may list more tables in the database than are strictly part of the 
|cyclus| interface, because of the need for |cyclus| to store metadata. Don't
be alarmed. Listing the current tables is easy:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cymetric test.h5 -l
    AgentEntry
    AgentStateAgent
    AgentStateInventories
    AgentState_agents_NullRegionInfo
    ...
    BlobKeys
    BlobVals
    BuildSchedule
    Compositions
    DecayMode
    Finish
    Info
    InputFiles
    MaterialInfo
    NextIds
    Prototypes
    Recipes
    ResCreators
    Resources
    Snapshots
    StringKeys
    StringVals
    Transactions
    XMLPPInfo

Metrics that are generated will show up in this listing after they have been computed.

Code Execution: ``-e``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Cymetric allows you to execute arbitrary code on metrics from the command line with 
the ``-e`` flag. The code that you pass in is pure Python. Every metric and root
|cyclus| table (see http://fuelcycle.org/user/dbdoc.html) are assigned automatically
to variable names that you can use. Indexing the table variables will return the 
metric as a pandas data frame (see http://pandas.pydata.org/). For example, to 
print the ``AgentEntry`` table, we would write ``AgentEntry[:]`` to get the 
table and ``print(AgentEntry[:])`` to display it after the ``-e`` flag:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cymetric test.h5 -e "print(AgentEntry[:])"
                                      SimId  AgentId      Kind                    Spec          Prototype  ParentId  Lifetime  EnterTime

Indexing a metric with an empty slice (``[:]``), none (``[None]``), or an ellipsis
(``[...]``) will return the full metric. However, you can also index by condition 
filters on the column names. The column names of the metric are thus also available for
use.  For example, let's just grab all of the facilities out of the entry table:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cymetric test.h5 -e "print(AgentEntry[Kind == 'Facility'])"
                                      SimId  AgentId      Kind                    Spec   Prototype  ParentId  Lifetime  EnterTime

    2  db805939-c565-404a-9483-adfb3da8b6d2       15  Facility  :cycamore:BatchReactor    Reactor1        12        -1          1
    3  db805939-c565-404a-9483-adfb3da8b6d2       16  Facility  :cycamore:BatchReactor    Reactor2        12        -1          2
    4  db805939-c565-404a-9483-adfb3da8b6d2       17  Facility  :cycamore:BatchReactor    Reactor3        12        -1          3

    [5 rows x 8 columns]

Separate the conditions by commas (``,``) to apply multiple filters at the same 
time:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cymetric test.h5 -e "print(AgentEntry[Kind == 'Facility', AgentId > 14])"
                                      SimId  AgentId      Kind                    Spec Prototype  ParentId  Lifetime  EnterTime
    0  db805939-c565-404a-9483-adfb3da8b6d2       15  Facility  :cycamore:BatchReactor  Reactor1        12        -1          1
    1  db805939-c565-404a-9483-adfb3da8b6d2       16  Facility  :cycamore:BatchReactor  Reactor2        12        -1          2
    2  db805939-c565-404a-9483-adfb3da8b6d2       17  Facility  :cycamore:BatchReactor  Reactor3        12        -1          3

    [3 rows x 8 columns]

Because code execution is just pure Python, we can do *anything* that we would be 
able to do in Python. Suppose that we have a ``Materials`` metric with a ``Mass``
column. We can compute this metric, pull the column out, multiply it by 42,
save the result to a variable, and then print this variable all via the following.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cymetric test.h5 -e "mass = Materials[:]['Mass'] * 42; print(mass)"

As a convenience, the following Python modules are available in the execution context 
under standard aliases. This prevents you from having to import them manually yourself.

===================== ==============
Module                Alias
===================== ==============
``cymetric``          ``cym``
``numpy``             ``np``
``pandas``            ``pd``
``uuid``              ``uuid``
``matplotlib``        ``matplotlib``
``matplotlib.pyplot`` ``plt``
===================== ==============

This let's you do neat things such as plot the metrics right from the command line.
For example,

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cymetric test.h5 -e "Materials[ResourceId == 15].plot(x='NucId', y='Mass', kind='bar'); plt.show()"

Will pop up with the following figure:

.. image:: ../../astatic/tut_nucid_mass.png

Python Interface
------------------
Using cymetric from Python is also easy.  Typically, it is recommended that you 
alias ``cymetric`` as ``cym``, because all of the important functionality lives here.
To start, use the ``dbopen()`` function to open up a database:

.. code-block:: python

    import cymetric as cym

    db = cym.dbopen('test.sqlite')

Evaluating Metrics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The main purpose of cymetric is to evaluate metrics. The easiest way to do this 
is via the ``eval()`` function. This accepts a metric name and a database and 
returns a pandas DataFrame:

.. code-block:: python

    frame = cym.eval('Materials', db) 

You may also optionally supply a list of 3-tuples representing the conditions to 
filter the metric on.

.. code-block:: python

    filtered_frame = cym.eval('Materials', db, conds=[('NucId', '==', 922350000)]) 

Calling ``eval()`` sets up a new ``Evaluator`` object each time a metric is 
evaluated.  This can be inefficient if you computing many metrics because it will 
have to read in from the database each time.  Thus, if you are planning on computing
many metrics, then its is better to create your own ``Evaluator`` and call its
``eval()`` method directly. For example, 

.. code-block:: python

    evaler = cym.Evaluator(db)
    frame1 = evaler.eval('Materials') 
    frame2 = evaler.eval('AgentEntry', conds=[('Kind', '==', 'Facility')]) 
    
And you can run with the data from there! We recommend learning pandas to get the 
most out of your analysis from this point.

Executing Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sometimes, you just have a code snippet as a string like you might run from the 
command line, even though you are in Python. The ``exec_code()`` function gives
you easy access to the exact same capabilities that you have on the command line.
This function accepts the code string and the database:

.. code-block:: python

    cym.exec_code("print(AgentEntry[:])", db)

For more exciting capabilities, please explore the online documentation or ask 
us questions on the mailing list.

Writing Metrics
------------------
Naturally, you do not want to be limited to your the metrics that come predefined
by cymetric. You have your own data and your own analysis that you want to perform.
Cymetric makes it easy to write your own metrics and fully hook into the cymetric 
tools.  

All you need to do is write a function that accepts pandas series, returns a pandas
data frame, and decorate it by the ``@metric()`` decorator found in cymetric.
For example, if you wanted to square the mass of materials as your
metric, you could write the following.  Call the new metric ``MaterialsSquared``.

.. code-block:: python

    deps = [('Materials', ('SimId', 'ResourceId', 'NucId'), 'Mass')]

    schema = [('SimId', cym.UUID), ('ResourceId', cym.INT),
              ('NucId', cym.INT),  ('MassSquared', cym.DOUBLE)]

    @cym.metric(name='MaterialsSquared', depends=deps, schema=schema)
    def mats_sqrd(series):
        mats = series[0]
        rtn = mats**2
        rtn.name = 'MaterialsSquared'
        rtn = rtn.reset_index()
        return rtn

Note that to write this metric, no knowledge of the database or any filters is
assumed. Cymetric handles all of these details for you!

In the above, the ``@metric()`` decorator takes three arguments. The first is 
the ``name`` of the metric. Note that this can be distinct from the function name.

The second is ``deps``, which represents the metric dependencies.  This is a list 
of 3-tuples that represents which ``series`` to pull out of the database and 
pass into the metric function (here ``mats_sqrd()``).  The first element is 
the table name as a string (eg ``'Materials'``). The second element is a tuple of 
column names that become the index of the series 
(eg ``('SimId', 'ResourceId', 'NucId')``). Finally, the last element is the 
column of the table that becomes the values of the series.  A metric may have 
as many dependencies as required. Circular dependencies are not allowed.

Lastly, the ``@metric()`` decorator takes a ``schema`` argument. This represents 
the structure of the metric table on disk and in |cyclus|. Thus, it is highly
tied to the |cyclus| type system (see http://fuelcycle.org/arche/dbtypes.html), 
as represented in cymetric. The data frame that is returned should have column 
names that match the schema provided. It is generally a good idea to include a 
``SimId`` column.  

The above shows how easy it is to incorporate metrics that are computed via 
cymetric. However, cymetric also helps you bring in data that might come from 
custom |cyclus| tables (see http://fuelcycle.org/arche/custom_tables.html).
All you need to do is use the ``root_metric()`` function somewhere. This simply 
accepts the name of the table.  For example, 

.. code-block:: python

    my_table = cym.root_metric(name='MyTable')

And that is all!
