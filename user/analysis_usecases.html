<h1>Use Cases for <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Cyclus</span> Data Analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#use-cases-for-cyclus-data-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This section will attempt to document a number of primary data exploration use
cases.  For an overview of the information recorded in a
<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Cyclus</span> simulation database, check out <a class="reference internal" href="dbdoc.html"><span class="doc">Understanding the Database</span></a>.  The two most common
modes are explorations of the material flows and the facility histories.</p>
<div class="section" id="material-flow-explorations">
<h2>Material flow explorations<a class="headerlink" href="#material-flow-explorations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Many material flow explorations would begin by visualizing the
time-dependent material flow between a set of sending facilities and a
set of receiving facilities.  The minimum information needed to
generate such a visualization is the population of the two sets of
facilities, and detailed discussion on how to populate these sets is
given below.  Once these sets are defined, the material flow
information can be summed over all the possible transaction pathways
at each time step to generate a single time series of data.  The
following discussion will identify ways to restrict/limit the
quantity of data represented in such a time series visualization based
primarily on filtering operations for different dimensions of the
material flow data.</p>
<p>It is important to note that single visualizations may contain
multiple time series of data, with a variety of alternative
representations depending on the user’s interests.  The following
discussion will consider, in this order:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>the resolution of the time domain,</li>
<li>filtering operations to restrict the data included in a single time series,</li>
<li>application of post-processing functions for alternative engineering responses, and</li>
<li>comparative visualization of multiple time series.</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<div class="section" id="time-domain-resolution-and-representation">
<h3>Time Domain Resolution and Representation<a class="headerlink" href="#time-domain-resolution-and-representation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Most simulations are expected to proceed with monthly time steps (this
is user-configurable), probably too fine for meaningful visualization.
The default resolution for such a visualization should be annual flows
of material, requiring a summation operation across non-overlapping
regions of the time domain.  It is likely that a user may want to
interactively change the time domain resolution, possibly interested
in the aggregated solution over time frames that are even coarser than
annual.</p>
<p>It is also likely that users may want to switch between visualizations
of the instantaneous material flow rate within a given step of the
time resolution, and a cumulative material flow, integrating from the
beginning of the simulation to the current step of the time
resolution.</p>
<p>In a related and common time series interaction, users may want to
zoom in and out of regions of the time domain to explore detailed
features.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="filtering-the-sets-of-participating-facilities">
<h3>Filtering the Sets of Participating Facilities<a class="headerlink" href="#filtering-the-sets-of-participating-facilities" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Filtering operations will be always be necessary to define the set of
facilities that participate in a given material flow visualization.
The simplest form of such a filter is the selection of an entire
market, thereby selecting all the facilities that participate in that
market.  Beyond that, some other obvious ways to create sets of
facilities for either the source or receiving set are:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>choosing individual facilities from a list of existing facilities</li>
<li>choosing individual institutions and therefore including all
facilities owned by that institution</li>
<li>choosing individual regions and therefore including all facilities
operating in that region</li>
<li>choosing a particular facility prototype and therefore including
all facilities based on that prototype</li>
<li>choosing a particular facility module and therefore including all
facilities based on that module</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The ideal user interface will allow subsets of facilities to be added
and deleted from the ultimate set of facilities using the notions of
intersection, union, and negation.</p>
<p>The ideal user interface will also allow a single time series to be
separated into multiple time series (possibly displayed in a
comparative fashion), by selecting a characteristic that defines
subsets of facilities.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="filtering-the-set-of-nuclides">
<h3>Filtering the Set of Nuclides<a class="headerlink" href="#filtering-the-set-of-nuclides" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It will also be important to restrict the material flow time series
data by filtering on the set of nuclides that are included in the
material flow data.  There are a small number of standard ways to
define sets of nuclides:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>include all nuclides</li>
<li>choose individual chemical elements (e.g. uranium) and thereby
including all the nuclides of that element</li>
<li>choose individual nuclides (e.g. U-235)</li>
<li>choose from predefined meaningful sets of nuclides
(e.g. fission products, actinides, transuranics, fissile nuclides)</li>
</ul>
<p>As with the facility filtering capability, an ideal user interface
will allow subsets of nuclides to be added and deleted from the data
set using the notions of intersection, union, and negation.</p>
<p>One example of a graph that shows the cumulative makeup of material in a
facility with respect to nuclide can be found in figure 5.11 of Kyle Oliver’s
masters thesis, GeniusV2: Software Design and Mathematical Formulations For
Multi-Region Discrete Nuclear Fuel Cycle Simulation And Analysis.</p>

<div class="section" id="post-processing-for-alternative-engineering-responses">
<h3>Post-processing for Alternative Engineering Responses<a class="headerlink" href="#post-processing-for-alternative-engineering-responses" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>While the fundamental material flows are defined as the raw quantity
of each nuclide that is being transacted, there will be a growing set
of transformations that convert these number densities into other
interesting metrics/quantities including:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>radiotoxicity</li>
<li>decay heat</li>
<li>waste volume</li>
<li>others to-be-determined</li>
</ul>
<p>Users will want to apply these transformations, either changing the
metric shown in the primary visualization or cloning the primary
visualization but showing the other metric.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="workflows-for-comparitive-time-series-exploration">
<h3>Workflows for Comparitive Time Series Exploration<a class="headerlink" href="#workflows-for-comparitive-time-series-exploration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Once a number of single time series are defined, it will be common to
visualize them on adjacent axes or within the same set of axes.  One
possible workflow is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>A user selects a market and is immediately shown the
instantaneous material flow through that market over the entire
simulation time domain, with a default time resolution.</li>
<li>A user selects the originating region as a characteristic that
splits the single material flow time series into multiple time
series, each one now defined with a set of source facilities
from a different region.  These time series are shown on the
same axes as a stacked area chart.  The envelope of these now
differentiated time series is identical to the envelope of the
original time series.</li>
<li>The user is then interested in a certain subset of the nuclides,
say the fissile nuclides, and requests that this same material
flow data be filtered to only include those nuclides.  Each of
the material flow time series may (or may not) be reduced as the
set of nuclides it includes is altered.  (Note that while it is
theoretically possible to differentiate by nuclide, it may
become difficult to visualize the many different time series
formed by differentiating by facility characteristic and nuclide
at the same time.  In some cases, especially where a small
number of nuclide subsets are identified, this may be
practical.)</li>
<li>At this point the user may seek a detailed isotopic breakdown of
one of the material flows, either as a time series shown on a
different axis pair, or as a single time step snapshot.  In the
latter case, a variety of options are available to visualize
this, including bar charts, pie charts, tables of data, and
other more advanced representations.  When examining a snapshot,
the linked visualization tool may update constantly as a user
swipes a bar across the time series visualization.</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>At this point, an ideal user interface may allow users to “tear-off”
individual time series from the collection of time series into
different axes for further exploration/differentiation in modes
similar to above.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="quasi-spatial-representation-of-material-flows">
<h3>(Quasi-)Spatial Representation of Material Flows<a class="headerlink" href="#quasi-spatial-representation-of-material-flows" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Another interesting visualization of this time series data is as an
animated graph representation.  Graph nodes would represent source and
receiving facilities with the connecting arcs somehow indicating the
magnitude of material flow (e.g. line thickness).  The time domain
would be represented by animation.</p>
<p>In some cases, the graphs of two different markets may be shown
together, indicating the connectedness of these graphs through
facilities that participate in both.  Different commodities could be
represented by different colors, for example.</p>
<p>Such a representation could also be coordinated with the more
traditional time series visualization, in which the graph serves as a
way to select which facilities will be included in the sets for
defining the material flow time series, either by selecting specific
nodes or by selecting specific arcs.</p>
<p>At such a time that geospatial data (or an approximation/surrogate to
this data) is available, this graph visualization could be arranged to
represent the real geospatial locations of facilities.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="commodity-capacity-and-supply-demand-exploration">
<h2>Commodity Capacity and Supply/Demand Exploration<a class="headerlink" href="#commodity-capacity-and-supply-demand-exploration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Another primary visualization is time series data for installed
capacity of a set of facilities.  Most of the operations discussed
above will be of interest including:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>time domain resolution and representation</li>
<li>filtering across different dimensions (although not across a nuclide dimension)</li>
<li>applying transformations</li>
<li>comparative visualization</li>
</ul>
<p>By combining the information about the theoretical capacity with the
information about material transactions, the relationship between
supply and demand can be explored.  (Note that the standardization of
input and output resource buffers within facilities means that
instantaneous transaction flow rates are not always representative of
instantaneous utilization of the available processing capacity.
Access to this information will require additional output records.)</p>
